There are 3 tabs in the Test Specification 

 

Features, Task Attachments, Test cases 

 

In Test cases there are the acceptance criteria and test steps and expected output 

 

The test steps across acceptance criteria may overlap 

 

This is intentional so that any failing tests can be redone independently
